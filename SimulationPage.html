		<legend><h4>The Global Food Security Game</h4></legend>
		<p>The simulation consists of 30 indicators or data points that give a 
		picture of food security in a specific country and region. Players are 
		tasked with improving food security in their region, and working toward 
		the U.N. Sustainable Goal of a hunger-free world by 2030. Students have 
		the opportunity to make important funding and programming decisions as 
		they work together to improve food security.<br />

				<h4>The UVA Bay Game&reg;</h4>
			</div>
			<p>CLSG&apos;s oldest game, the <a href="http://www.virginia.edu/baygame">UVA 
			Bay Game&reg;</a>, has been played more than 200 times by diverse audiences 
			ranging from high schools to the U.S. House of Representatives, GE 
			Water &amp; Power to NOAA and the EPA. This online, 
			multiplayer, game shoulders on participants the responsibilities of 
			real-world stakeholders who live in and make a living on the Chesapeake 
			Bay Watershed, including Crop Farmers, Land Developers, Watermen and 
			state-level policymakers. Players learn the impacts of their decisions 
			on the health of Bay and work together to balance both environmental and 
			economic sustainability.</p>

				<h4>The Louisiana Coastal Resilience Game</h4>
			</div>
			<p>What does the future hold for culture, industry, and ecology along the 
			coast of Louisiana? What can be done about it? The Louisiana Coastal 
			Resilience Game allows federal, state, and local regulators, as well as 
			corporations and NGOs, to implement protective and restorative efforts of 
			varying costs and estimated degrees of impact along Louisiana&apos;s coastline 
			and observe potential future outcomes under different policy and weather 
			scenarios. Actions available to players are well-grounded, derived from 
			research done by McKinsey &amp; Co. and from the Louisiana Coastal Protection 
			and Restoration Authority&apos;s &apos;State Master Plan&apos;.</p>

				<h4>Poverty Simulation</h4>
			</div>
			<p>Can you survive a month in poverty? 
			<a href="http://www.povertysimulation.net/">Poverty Sim</a> participants 
			take on the roles of members of impoverished families or staffers at 
			community agencies and resources that support low-income families. The 
			objective is to sensitize us to the day-to-day realities of life faced by 
			people with low incomes in the US and abroad and to motivate us to become 
			involved in activities which help to mitigate poverty here and globally. 
			Your goals may include keeping your home secure, providing food and 
			clothing for your family, making your utility and loan payments on time, 
			or helping your children through school, all while responding to unexpected 
			and sometimes unfortunate events.</p>

				<h4>Pensions Simulation</h4>
			</div>
			<p>The pensions simulation in PPOL7010 and PLCP3120 tries to show students 
			that there is no single technocratic answer to whether pensions should be 
			expanded or cut back. Rather, most choices around pensions are about moral 
			preferences or decisions about who should work and how much. Students can 
			vary a number of important parameters (retirement age, payouts, tax levels) 
			and see their putative effects on important macro-economic variables. This 
			opens up a discussion about the basis for the choice of parameters and also
			the underlying assumptions behind the model.  Additionally, starting 
			conditions for the sim are based on real world countries, illustrating 
			variations in the challenges facing different countries.</p>
