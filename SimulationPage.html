    <h2>Simulations</h2>
    
    <h4>The Global Food Security Game</h4>
    <p>The simulation consists of 30 indicators or data points that give a 
    picture of food security in a specific country and region. Players are 
    tasked with improving food security in their region, and working toward 
    the U.N. Sustainable Goal of a hunger-free world by 2030. Students have 
    the opportunity to make important funding and programming decisions as 
    they work together to improve food security.</p>

    <h4>The UVA Bay Game&reg;</h4>
    <p>CLSG&apos;s oldest game, the <a href="http://www.virginia.edu/baygame">UVA 
    Bay Game&reg;</a>, has been played more than 200 times by diverse audiences 
    ranging from high schools to the U.S. House of Representatives, GE 
    Water &amp; Power to NOAA and the EPA. This online, 
    multiplayer, game shoulders on participants the responsibilities of 
    real-world stakeholders who live in and make a living on the Chesapeake 
    Bay Watershed, including Crop Farmers, Land Developers, Watermen and 
    state-level policymakers. Players learn the impacts of their decisions 
    on the health of Bay and work together to balance both environmental and 
    economic sustainability.</p>
